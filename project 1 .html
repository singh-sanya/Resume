            <li>
                <h2>OPAM based Square wave generator</h2>
                <p> • I successfully developed an Opamp-driven Square Wave Generator during an electronics project, demonstrating my expertise
                      inOpamp circuits and circuit design principles.
                    • By leveraging operational amplifiers (Opamps), I constructed a circuit that produces square wave signals with precise frequency and
                      amplitude characteristics. This involved comprehending Opamp
                      functionality,feedback configurations, andwaveformshaping techniques.
                    • The project employed Opamps, passive components (resistors, capacitors), and a breadboard/PCB for prototyping. Through this
                      endeavor, I acquired proficiency in Opamp circuits, circuit design, and waveform generation, underscoring my practical grasp
                      of electronics and ability to devise practical circuits fortargeted applications</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2> R TO 2R LADDER DAC USING O PAMP LM-741</h2>
                <p>• I designed and implemented an R to 2R ladder digital-to-analog
                     converter (DAC) using Opamp LM-741.This project required expertise in Opamp circuits, circuit design, and digital-to-analog conversion principles.
                    • I utilized the R to 2R ladder architecture to convert digital input
                      signals into corresponding analog output voltages. The technology
                      stack involvedOpamp LM-741,resistors, capacitors, and prototyping on a breadboard/PCB. This project showcases my proficiency
                      in electronics, circuit design, and practical application of Opamp-based on DACs</p>
            </li>
            <li><h2>ONLINE RECIPE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM</h2>
                <p>
                    • I utilized my expertise in Python, Django, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
                      and Git to develop an Online Recipe Management System.
                    • This web-based platform empowers users to effectively manage
                      and share their favorite recipes. Leveraging Django, a Python
                       web framework, I constructed the system’s core functionality with
                       seamless integrationandefficient coding. HTML andCSSwere employed to create an intuitive and visually appealing user interface,
                       while JavaScript enhanced interactivity.
                    • The application encompasses user registration, recipe creation/editing, categorization/tagging, search functionality, favoriting/rating, and social interaction.
                    • By implementing Git for version control, I ensured smooth collaboration and seamless integration of new features. This project
                       highlights my comprehensive skill set in Python, Django, HTML,
                       CSS, JavaScript, and Git, emphasizing my ability to develop userfriendly web applications forrecipe manageme
